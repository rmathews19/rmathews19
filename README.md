Hi, My name is Reevan. I am a Honors Computer Science Student at the University of Texas at Dallas that loves working in the field of artificial intelligence! 

I have been coding for over 7 years now and love working with Data Science and Machine Learning. I have experience with Data Structures & Algorithms, Java, Python, C++/C, Git, MySQL, HTML, Pandas, React, Angular, Linux, TensorFlow, Data Analysis and much more!

I am currently expanding my knowledge in many areas and i'd love to collaborate on any projects that involve backend or even frontend programming, data science and especially any hackathon programming.
